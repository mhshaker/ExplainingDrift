      "The Funniest Ever Caddyshack is the funniest movie ever. From Dangerfield's cracks to Murray and the gopher. The movie is supposed to be about a caddy named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) but nobody really cares about him. Everybody likes  the hilarious antics of Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, and  Ted Knight better. This movie ranks up there with Animal House as an  all-time comedy great. You will be reciting the quotes for years.\n",

      "Worthwhile viewing Many people who saw this film were shocked by the way it candidly dealt with subjects such as statutory rape, sex, lesbianism and adultry.  However, the overall message this film brings out by use of these  &quot;real-life&quot; devices is superb and should excuse any material some  may find offensive.  The story basically revolves around events that take  place in the lives of Matthew Borderick and Reese Witherspoon during a  yearly school election.  I found it hilarous and the charcters very true to  life.  In particular Matthew and Reese.  Reese's performance in this film  is excellent.  If you are a fan a Reese I would suggest checking out  S.F.W.(small role) or Twilight (she has a partial nude scene in this one).\n",

My only complaint is that the DVD didn't have any extras.  Some commentary from Milos Forman, or Courtney Love would have been  fantastic.\n",

      "Spectacular Film The Red Violin was one of my favorite films of 1999.  The music, story telling method, and camera work was spectacular.  The journey of this violin through 400 years in Italy, Austria, England, China, and the US was  a fantastic story of both success and loss.  This was the type of film I  thought about for days after seeing it.  The only drawback was the  selection of Samuel L. Jackson for a key part in the film.  He was not the  right fit for the role.  Overall... if you have not seen this film, it  should be at the top of your list!\n",

      "The Super Genius Edition is the one to own This is the definitive DVD edition of A Bugs Life.  The film makers call it &quot;The Super Genius Edition&quot; and I have to agree.  They included everything in this two disc edition.  Not only do we get both sets of  outtakes, but we get Geri's Game (old man playing chess), the trailers  (including one for international release), deleted scenes, storyboards,  pictures, making of segments and more.  It can easily take you 3 hours to  go through all the extras on this disc.  If you have ever wanted to know  how this movie was made, this disc will tell you!\n",

      "amazing british comedy ab fab is totally amazing. the series characters  are so totally outrageous that you wont believe it however my english husband says that he knew people just like them!  they relate to every day life in their own  unique way yet somehow it is  always relevant to today. women especially  can  relate to eddie &amp; patsy regardless of the year. somehow the men  are always condescending yet the &quot;girls&quot; see through it and  triumph. Eddie &amp; Patsy are always enertaining trying to be  adult while  remaining in the adolescent sixties! if you appreciate a dry english sense  of humor these characters will appeal to you.\n",

      "machines improve, but people don't In spite of so many years this movie still attains to impress me. Perhaps with the time, &quot;Fail Safe&quot; looks as made for tv withouth much money. Sets seems poor because one expect installations of USAF must be, as  is said in the film - &quot;the best&quot;- . It's said that the big  computers from 1960 hadn't the fraction power of a PC of today. Sure the  USA Army possess now the best machines, but as in this film, all these  doesn't calm very much, because this &quot;Fail Safe&quot; is mainly human.  Yes there's a fail in the communications, but these safety system has been  previously conceived by men which knew such possibilities of error, for  that this movie is very credible and frightful, and beyond all these, one  can see that if electronics and computers rigth now are much more powerful  and reliable, curiously it would be difficult to find so superb actors  rigth now as in this film. Not only Henry Fonda and Walter Mattau, but all  secondary characters are really  extraordinary so, one can ask himself if  politics and military people of today also are as good and are improved as  war technology  has done. I'm afraid the answer is negative and of course,  knowing one of the world leaders starts the day with plenty of vodka when  not awakening at the hospital is all but comforting.\n",

      "THE APES SAGA COMES FULL CIRCLE \"BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES\" (1973)is the fith and final entry in the \"PLANET OF THE APES\" series. It is directed by J. Lee Thompson.    Set in flashback to the turn of the 21st Century, this sequel focuses on the ape leader, Caesar (Roddy McDowall), about ten years after he led the ape revolution in the previous film, \"CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES.\" In this post-nuclear war society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between his simian peers and the surviving remains of humanity. Gorilla leader Aldo (Claude Akins), however, wants nothing to do this, as it reminds him of his former enslavement, so he plots Caesar's overthrow and doom, as do a band of mutated humans from their former city of the last film who want to reclaim Earth and destroy the entire ape society.    Towards the end of the movie, however, Aldo and the human mutants are overthrown. The apes and humans then decide to coexist with one another and they begin to make a new society.    It turns out that the story is being told by an elderly ape (the Great Lawgiver, played by John Huston) over 600 years later to a group of young humans and apes. It is left ambiguous as to whether the ape-dominated society as in seen in the first film, and the eventual destruction of Earth as seen in the second, will actually come to pass. However, as this film takes place after a nuclear war has nearly wiped out civilzation, at least one major element the first film still comes to pass.\n",

      "I'd give it 6 stars if I could You can use 1,000 words to describe Casablanca but it all comes down to superb acting from the lead actors to the bit players, outstanding writing from the Epstein brothers and Howard Koch, a great score from Max Steiner  and direction from Michael Curtiz that moves a 1-hour, 42-minute movie like  gangbusters from start to finish without a single special effect. Let  others see Star Wars 400 times. I could watch Casablanca every day until  Y3K and never get tired of it.\n",

      "Fantasy come to life The story about a young hero's quest to save the world from destruction has been told many times, but never like this. This film is pure imagination, the kind of movie that never gets made anymore. Jim Henson  truly went all out with this one.  The use of puppets to tell the entire  story was incredible.  I still remember how I felt the first time I saw  this when I was a child;I still feel that way now.  As a conceptual arist,  Brian Froud's work speaks for itself. This is truly one of the most  original and fascinating films to ever be created, the result of an  incredible vision. It's too bad that Henson died before any more of these  visions could be seen.\n"
